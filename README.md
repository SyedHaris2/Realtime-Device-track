## Features
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSockets update Device locations in real-time.
- **Interactive Map**: Displays device locations using the Leaflet library on a map.
- **Express Backend**: Handles server-side logic and API endpoints.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Built with scalability in mind, making it suitable for large-scale implementations.

## Technologies Used
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for server-side development.
- **Express**: Web framework for building the server and API.
- **Socket.IO**: Enables real-time bidirectional communication between web clients and servers.
- **Leaflet**: Open-source JavaScript library for interactive maps.
- **HTML/CSS**: Basic web technologies for the front-end.
